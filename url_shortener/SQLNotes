Notes

SQLite3 (vs PostgeSQL)

to open SQLite3, command:
sqlite3 <file_name>
    .tables == \d
    .schema == the SQL that was written to create the tables

    to insert
    INSERT INTO <table_name>
        (col1, col2, etc)
        VALUES
        (val1, val2, etc),
        (val3, val4, etc);

        to update

        UPDATE <table_name>
            SET col1=val1
            WHERE id = 9;

            UPDATE users
            SET age = 21
            WHERE id = 3;

            UPDATE users
            SET age = 21
            WHERE birthyear >= 2001;


RAILS
    MVC = Model View Controller
        the model is concerned with the retreival of inforamtion from storage (and any logic)
        view is concerned with presenting the info
        controller is concerned with constructing the servers HTTP response; sends commands to the model to fetch and update; and to the view to display
            it is the interface between the model and the view
    CoC = convention over configuration
        preloaded with configuration and the developer only has to be worried when doing something unconventional
        *naming conventions = cats == model name- Cats, default controller-CatsController
        ^ will automatically know how to load and tie together
    REST = Representational State Transfer
        architechtual style for web services
        a RESTful web service uses standard operations
            GET     along with a specific id, will return data on that item
            POST
            PATCH
            DELETE
        RESTful webservices are stateless (each request is independent of others)
        Rails defaults to a RESTful API using [resources] method - automatically generates routes by linking HTTP verbs and URIs to controller actions

    Components
        Active Record
            is an ORM (object relational mapping)
